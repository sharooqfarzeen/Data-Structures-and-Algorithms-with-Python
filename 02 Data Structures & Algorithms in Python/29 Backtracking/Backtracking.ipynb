The maze would be given in the form of a square matrix of order 'N' * 'N' where the cells with value 0 represent the mazeâ€™s blocked locations while value 1 is the open/available path that the rat can take to reach its destination. The rat's destination is at ('N' - 1, 'N' - 1). Your task is to find all the possible paths that the rat can take to reach from source to destination in the maze. The possible directions that it can take to move in the maze are 'U'(up) i.e. (x, y - 1) , 'D'(down) i.e. (x, y + 1) , 'L' (left) i.e. (x - 1, y), 'R' (right) i.e. (x + 1, y).\n","\n","Note:\n","Here, sorted paths mean that the expected output should be in alphabetical order.\n","For Example:\n","Given a square matrix of size 4*4 (i.e. here 'N' = 4):\n","1 0 0 0\n","1 1 0 0\n","1 1 0 0\n","0 1 1 1\n","Expected Output:\n","DDRDRR DRDDRR\n","i.e. Path-1: DDRDRR and Path-2: DRDDRR\n","\n","The rat can reach the destination at (3, 3) from (0, 0) by two paths, i.e. DRDDRR and DDRDRR when printed in sorted order, we get DDRDRR DRDDRR.\n","```"],"metadata":{"id":"i5nWJWM05p4m"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["\n","\n","```\n","fn(row, col, visited, path)\n","\n","Initialize:\n","  visited -> n*n matrix with all False\n","  path -> empty string\n","\n","1 call fn(0, 0, visited, path)\n","2 Update Visited\n","3 Down\n","  3.1 Check if down(row+1, col) is valid\n","    3.1.1 Is row+1 < n, Is (row+1, col) blocked, Is (row+1)(col+1) visited\n","    3.1.2 If valid visit\n","      3.1.2.1 Is (row+1, col) (N-1, N-1)\n","                If yes add path to route array\n","                Return\n","      3.1.2.2 Else Go to 2\n","    3.1.3 If Invalid return\n","4 Left\n","5 Right\n","6 Up\n","```\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"lZjouN9B8omg"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#stores valid routes from origin to end\n","routes = []\n","#stores the maze\n","arr = [[]]\n","#number of columns/rows of the square matrix\n","n = 0\n","\n","#checks if upcoming cell is valid\n","def is_valid(row, col, visited):\n","  #if cell is out of bounds or cell/route is blocked or it has already been visited, it is an invalid cell/route\n","  if (row > n-1) or (col < 0) or (col > n-1) or (row < 0) or (arr[row][col] == 0) or (visited[row][col] == True):\n","    return False\n","  return True\n","\n","def rat_helper(row, col, visited, path):\n","\n","  #end reached\n","  if (row, col) == (n-1, n-1):\n","    routes.append(path)\n","    return\n","\n","  #cell has been visited while in the current route\n","  visited[row][col] = True\n","\n","  #Down Path\n","  #Check if Down is valid\n","  if is_valid(row+1, col, visited):\n","    #Go Down\n","    rat_helper(row+1, col, visited, path + 'D')\n","    #remove trace while backtracking\n","    visited[row+1][col] = False\n","\n","  #Left Path\n","  #Check if Left is valid\n","  if is_valid(row, col-1, visited):\n","    #Go Left\n","    rat_helper(row, col-1, visited, path + 'L')\n","    #remove trace while backtracking\n","    visited[row][col-1] = False\n","\n","  #Right Path\n","  #Check if Right is valid\n","  if is_valid(row, col+1, visited):\n","    #Go Right\n","    rat_helper(row, col+1, visited, path + 'R')\n","    #remove trace while backtracking\n","    visited[row][col+1] = False\n","\n","  #Up Path\n","  #Check if Up is valid\n","  if is_valid(row-1, col, visited):\n","    #Go Up\n","    rat_helper(row-1, col, visited, path + 'U')\n","    #remove trace while backtracking\n","    visited[row-1][col] = False\n","\n","\n","def searchMaze(array, N):\n","  #empty maze or origin is blocked(=0)\n","  if N == 0 or array[0][0] == 0:\n","    return routes\n","\n","  #passing references to global variables\n","  global arr, n\n","  n = N\n","  arr = array\n","  # n*n matrix to track visited cells\n","  visited = [[False] * n for i in range(n)]\n","  #tracks current path\n","  path = \"\"\n","  #find routes to target, starting from origin(cell (0,0))\n","  rat_helper(0, 0, visited, path)\n","  return routes"],"metadata":{"id":"Fc8LI_HjVXqT"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
